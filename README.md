#Importance of Rotation in Collision Response

#In simulations where objects bounce off a rotating platform, the platform's rotation directly influences the angle at which the objects bounce. Here's why this matters:

#Bounce Angle Variation:
  The platform's rotation alters the collision angle, affecting how objects rebound.
  Different platform orientations result in varied bounce trajectories, adding diversity to interactions.

#Realistic Physics:
  Reflecting real-world physics, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
  Considering platform rotation ensures that objects bounce off in believable directions, enhancing realism.

#Gameplay Dynamics:
  Rotating platforms introduce dynamic challenges and gameplay depth.
  Players must adapt to changing platform orientations, adding strategic depth to the experience.

#Mechanical Customization:
  Control over platform rotation enables unique game mechanics and puzzles.
  Developers can design levels where platform orientation directly impacts gameplay mechanics.

#Visual Clarity:
  Visible platform rotation provides clear feedback to players.
  Users can anticipate bounce angles based on platform orientation, aiding in decision-making.

#My C# code was made to solve all of these problems in Particle.cs and ParticleSpawner.cs
